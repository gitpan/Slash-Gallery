This is Slash::Gallery, a picture gallery plugin for Slash.

        http://slashcode.com/

It requires the Imager and Image::Info modules.

It is not yet ready for prime time, but it works.  Some quick
instructions:

1. Place all of your images in your datadir, under gallery/full/.
You may organize the images any way you wish.  I prefer year/month/,
so I have:

        /usr/local/slash/sites/pudge.net/gallery/full/2001/08/
        /usr/local/slash/sites/pudge.net/gallery/full/2001/09/
        /usr/local/slash/sites/pudge.net/gallery/full/2001/10/

etc.  The location of the files in the filesystem is not relevant
to Slash::Gallery.

Slash::Gallery will automatically create other directories under
gallery for scaled images (including thumbnails), so make sure it
is writable by your web server user.


2. Install Slash::Gallery if you haven't already, and go to
gallery.pl in your browser.  Make sure you are logged in as an
admin (default admin seclev for Slash::Gallery is 1000).


3. Add pictures from the filesystem to the database by clicking
the "Add Pictures" link.  This will go through all the pictures
under $datadir/gallery/full/ and add the ones that are not yet
in the database.  The images are differentiated by filename,
so don't change the location of a file.

Each image is added to the database with a name (by default,
the relative filename, but can be anything) and a date.
The date is pulled out of the embedded date in the image's
EXIF tag, if it exists.  If not, the file's date on the filesystem
is used.


4. If you want to prerender all the scaled images, click
"Render Pictures", and go have a cup of coffee.  If you don't
do this step, the first time each scaled image (including
thumbnails) is requested, Slash::Gallery will have to create it.
Slash::Gallery won't create the scaled image again, unless it
finds that the original is newer than the scaled image.

Pictures are rendered according to the specs at the top of
gallery.pl.  By default, there are big, large, medium, small, and
thumnbnail pictures (as well as the original "full" size).
Images are scaled according to the X coordinate for the given
size (unless the image is vertical (Y > X), in which case it uses
Y), so images of different aspect ratios are allowed.


5. Start browsing by clicking "All Pictures".  You will be shown
thumnails, along with the picture name and date, and a menu
allowing you to select [s]mall, [m]edium, [l]arge, [b]ig, or
[d]isplay.

The Display screen shows the picture's description and any
EXIF information you want.  Customize this template to suit your
needs.  See Image::Info docs etc. for information on what
tags are available; they are all in the [% picture.info %]
data structure.


That's about it for now.  Have fun,
